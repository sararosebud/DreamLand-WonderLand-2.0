//! 'mutation login' function takes in $email and $password values from front end

//! Input changes are handled to update the form state. 

//! It includes a form with various input fields for collecting user information. 

//! Nav wrap to provide navigation functionality

//! Provider store wrap to allow all components access to the global state defined in the "store.js"

//! Routes component has various Route components all with specific paths and corresponding component to render

//! The component also includes navigation links and styling for the signup form.

//! The form submission triggers a mutation to add the user, 

//! and finally recieves a response object with the token and user

//! and the user is then logged in using the generated token. 

//! cartOpen: false,

//! checks if currentsize exists, if no currentsize warning is given a string value, and appears in in hmtl further down

//! checks if state.cart has data and if not gets product data from 

//! checks the state.cart for a product that matches with the payload(action.id, action.size), 

//! component handles user signup functionality. 

//! does the ADD_ORDER mutation with the products array as the variable option

//! for every item in productData, it is removed from the indexDB

//! function logic for adding to cart is button is clicked

//! i tried to mimic the action above's structure

//! i tried to mimic the structure of action above

//! if itemInCart has data aka its in cart state then update its quantity

//! if no match to cart, add a product with our local state values to the store cart

//! if size warning is set to empty and doesnt appear

//! indexDB, passes that data as the payload to the ADD_MULTIPLE_TO_CART action type

//! intital local state and its update function are declared with useState hook

//! it reads the items from the 'cart' indexDB and assigns it to cart variable

//! local state for this component is declared, "formState" intital state including two empty fields for email and password, and 'setFormState' to update it

//! looks for item existing in cart matching our size and id and assigns to itemInCart if found

//! makes a products array by mapping each item in the cart with its item._id

//! mutation is declared to add user

//! necessary dependencies imported

//! on stripe success of payment this page is loaded that has the logic to add the order to users order

//! on submit all the item ids are psuhed into a productIDs array

//! passed into getcheckout and used as the options for QUERYCHECKOUT

//! passes them to login server mutation requirements by the '$'

//! remove from cart checks for size and id

//! reset quantity input form to 1

//! returns updated product to store cart

//! router wrap to handle routing

//! since the item is being passed in as a prop from cart component with "state.cart.map((item).... <CartItem item='item'/>" we dont need state

//! takes the state.cart and spreads it, updating it with payload/data for the product(action.product), then returns the updated state with new cart

//! the sessionid is extracted and helps redirect to the stripe checkout page

//! the whole app is wrapped in the apolloclient allowing all components to connect with the graphQL database

//! timer redirects to home '/'

//! useMutation points toward LOGIN mutation, with login function deconstructed

//! when the data exist/updates from the QUERYCHECKOUT response

//! when the data response is recieved from the mutation, the products are extracted from the data into productData array

//!spreads that product and updates the quantity with payload quantity
